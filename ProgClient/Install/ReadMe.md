Here you can found how setup and install the different part of the
project :

	1- Setup the Network Attached Storage wich is also name NAS:

		- For this you need to setup a NAS wich have the possibilities to
			create an NFS share directory and, if you don't want to connect
			all the RPI to internet but have the RPI at the good time, the
			possibilities to make a NTP server. For this i can recommand you
				- Synology : allready mount you have just the config to make but
					it cost 200â‚¬
				- OpenMediaVault : based and debian and open-source but you need
					install it on a computer by yourself but is free if you have an
					old computer and because is a debian like you have a debian system
					on the computer so you can use apt and other linux command.
		

	2-Now we have our NAS ready we can now install the MQTT broker

		But where install it ? You have two choice here :
			- On the NAS if it is possible
			- On an another computer, maibye the same that
				the web server
		To install it :
			1- download the 'MQTT_broker' directory
			2- Open a terminal and go in the directory : 'cd path/of/MQTT_broker/directory'
			3- 'sudo chmod +x ./install.sh' and './install.sh'
			4- The script reboot your computer when the broker is installed

Now we have all the server part ready for the next step, we need
ip address of NAS and MQTT broker so write it somewhere.


	3- To start we will install the Venv python that we need to execute the client.

		Install of venv python:
			1- Download 'Python-venv' directory => git clone or wget
			2- Open a terminal and go in the directory : 'cd path/of/Python-venv/directory'
			3- open install.sh and set the good information
				about nas ip and name of share directory
			4- 'sudo chmod +x ./install.sh' and './install.sh'
			5- if the computer shutdown is good
		
		When you have the venv correctly installed you need to add the 'prog' directory
		in the venv folder and set inforamtion about nas ip in 'connect.sh' and broker
		ip in 'boot.py' and 'prog.py', in the prog folder.
			
	4- Now we can install the client for the fisrt RPI
		Install the client:
			1- Install PI os without desktop' on a pi 3
			2- Download the 'Client' directory on the pi => wget or git clone
			3- Open a terminal and go to in the directory
			4- 'sudo chmod +x ./install.sh' and './install.sh'
			5- After a while open raspi-config and here you need to to
				'3 Interface Options' then 'P1 Camera' then 'yes'
			6- Open '/media/connect.sh' and set information about nas ip
				and name of share directory
			7- 'sudo reboot'
			8- The pi download the good 'connect.sh' script on the share
				directory and reboot the first time automatycally so
				wait few minutes and don't worry
			
	5- Now you can duplicate this client on an another SD card for that
		you can use win32diskimager to create a .img and write it an another
		SD cards.
